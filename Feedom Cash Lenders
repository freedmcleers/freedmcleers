Closing costs vary from lender to lender. Some lenders may waive some fees as a perk, but generally, youâ€™ll pay for an appraisal, origination fee, document preparation fee, credit report fee, and title search. Typically, closing costs will be anywhere from 2% to 5% of your home equity loan amount. Many lenders will roll these costs into your loan payment to avoid up-front fees.

How Much Can I Borrow on a Home Equity Loan?

Your total loan amount depends on how much equity you have in your home. Most lenders will only let you borrow up to 80% of your total equity.

Home equity loans are flexible tools for homeowners to borrow significant amounts of money. With rates typically a bit higher than mortgage rates but significantly lower than credit cards, they offer affordable access to cash. While mortgage rates are rising, they are still low enough to make a home equity loan attractive to the average homeowner.
