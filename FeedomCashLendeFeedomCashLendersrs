Simply put, a home equity loan is a lump sum loan using your primary residence as collateral. As you make mortgage payments on your house, you build equity. If the value of your home goes up due to market trends, your equity also increases.

A home equity loan is a very flexible toolâ€”repayment terms range from five to 30 years, with fixed interest rates and payments. And since the loan is paid in a lump sum, you can use it for whatever you wish, including home renovations, paying down higher-interest debt, or funding an education.
